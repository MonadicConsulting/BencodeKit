# BencodeKit
This project's main intent is to allow you to deserialise and reserialise .torrent files natively in Swift without having to worry about all the null pointer and potential segfault stuff that comes with using a C library.

# Usage
I recommend using Carthage to add BencodeKit to your project.

Add the following to your Cartfile:
```
github "MonadicConsulting/BencodeKit"
```
